# 🌊 Flood Segmentation using Attention U-Net

This project focuses on detecting and highlighting **flooded areas** in **satellite and drone imagery** using an **Attention U-Net** architecture. The model accurately segments flood-affected regions, supporting disaster management, response planning, and environmental analysis.

## 🚀 Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **deep learning–based segmentation system** capable of analyzing post-flood imagery and differentiating between water and non-water regions. Attention U-Net enhances the standard U-Net architecture by incorporating attention gates, enabling the model to focus on relevant spatial regions more effectively.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

* **Base Model:** Attention U-Net
* **Frameworks:** TensorFlow / Keras
* **Image Processing:** OpenCV
* **Language:** Python

The model leverages **encoder–decoder architecture** with skip connections and attention blocks to refine segmentation masks and minimize false positives.

## ⚙️ Features

* High-accuracy segmentation on satellite and drone images
* Robust to varying lighting and environmental conditions
* Modular code for easy retraining and dataset expansion
* Flask-based interface for local inference and visualization

## 📂 Tools and Technologies
